# Let's Play In-between

In between is a popular gambling game most commonly played during Lunar New Year. You can play it for fun, or use real **$** if you are feeling rich :D.

## How to play
1. Pick a pair of cards by clicking `NEXT`.
2. Once you have picked a pair of your liking, click `SHOW CARD` and see if the middle card's value is within the pair.
3. If the middle card value is **EQUAL** to any of the values in the pair, you lose double!
4. Carry on to the next player by clicking `NEXT` again!

## Pot
- You can fill up the pot at the start of each game, and update the pot after the end of each round!

## Game Modes
### 1.Infinite
Randomly generate values from an infinite "deck" of cards. Probability of each pair is non-deterministic.
### 2.Standard
Starts the game with a standard poker deck of 52 cards. After each pair is drawn, and each middle card is shown, the cards will be removed from the deck.

Once the deck has been exhausted, it will reset with a fresh set of cards!

Have fun!
